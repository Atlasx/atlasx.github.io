          <h2>Connor J Douglas <small>Programmer, Designer, Gamer, and more</small></h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I am Connor Douglas, a game developer from Honolulu, Hawai’i, currently looking for work in the gaming industry.
            My involvement with the Robotics team in high school fostered an early interest in computer science, programming, and
            friendly technological competition. I’ve since pursued these interests and built AAA games as well as participated in game jams, hackathons, collaborative
            coding projects, and of course a healthy dose of gaming in my free time.
          </p>
          <p>
              With around 13 years of programming experience and 4 years of professional industy experience, I have a solid foundation upon which I pursue the goal of creating fun and
              compelling video games. At Volition I was a part of the missions team, collaborating with a multi-disciplinary set of developers tasked with bringing linear story content to life.
              We shipped the game after 3 years of developement and then turned our focus to DLC packs, both published over the course of the next year. DLC missions were made with a tightened
              production timeline to deliver to our publisher.

              At the University of Utah's EAE program, I worked in teams of 4-16 programmers, artists, designers, and
              producers. In one of these teams, we created “Parts Per Million”, a climate focused hex tile game, which was featured in the end
              of year EAE Day program party. For our capstone course, a team of 16 developed Kickshot, a speed-running focuesed game with rocket jumping, grappling, and wall running which we released for free on Steam.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2013 I interned with UHERO, a Hawai’i based economic research organization at the University of Hawai’i, to create a database
            backed web application. At Punahou School in 2017, I worked as a teaching assistant for the course Coding and Game Design.
            We taught code and design fundamentals to middle school students interested in computer science.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not immersed in the digital world, I've enjoyed basking on the beaches of Oahu, hiking the arid hills of Utah, biking
            the streets of Honolulu, and skiing the alpine basins of the Wasatch. I’m also an avid trombone player with eleven years of
            practice and performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am excited for a future of collaboration and creation with fellow game designers and creators. I love hearing about game
            development, computer science, or any thing else, so shoot me an email.
          </p>
